# Purpose
This is a testing environment for NGINX configurations that run in a Docker container.

# Disclaimers - DO NOT USE THIS A PRODUCTION AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM!
This repo is meant for education purposes only for testing in a Docker container on a local machine.

This module shows a simple NGINX authentication check. It is not a secure authentication system as it only check for the existence of a bear token, and does nothing to examine its contents. To make this a rigorous security system, additional logic or API calls are necessary. The authors are not responsible for any loss or damage that occurs as the result of the improper use of this code.
